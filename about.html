      <p>
        My short term goal is to create an E-Commerce website for my own shoe
        store where guests can see what I have in stock straight from the
        website and guests can easily filter through sizes, colors, and
        shillouettes of shoes they are looking for.

      <h2>Long Term Goal</h2>
      <img src="assets/shoe-store.jpg" alt="Picture of a shoe store" />
      <p>
        My long term goal is to have multiple shoe stores and start a franchise
        where all shoe stores also have vintage clothes, vinyls, merch from
        artists tours, and all things centered around the Hip-Hop/Rap culture.
