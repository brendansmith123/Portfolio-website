      <h2>My First Project</h2>
      <p>
        My first project working on a grocery list with HTML using 3 different
        headers, 4 tables for each category of food items, and for images. Then
        using CSS to change the color for the main header, adding borders around
        titles, adding color to the tables, and for resizing images.

      <h2>My Second Project</h2>
      <p>
        My second project is called Secure The Vault that has a dialog box that
        reads out a message saying "You have received this message because you
        have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret
        combination:" then assigns 3 variables using arithmetic operators to
        equal the combination 10 - 40 - 39 then reads out the combination in the
        same dialog box using JavaScript.
